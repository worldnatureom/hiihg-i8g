			<div class="content">Imam Hassan ( عليه السلام) was the eldest son of Imam Ali and Lady Fatimah and the grandson of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. Born in 625 CE, Imam Hassan is the 5th caliph after his father, Abu Turab.

			His brief caliphate was marked by his decision to relinquish power in favor of peace, choosing to make a treaty with Ameerul Mu'mineen Mu'awiyah to avoid further bloodshed among the Muslim community. This decision demonstrated his wisdom and commitment to preserving the unity of the ummah (Muslim community), even at the cost of his own political ambitions.

			Imam Hassan's character is known for upholding the values of Islam. He was also known for his generosity and kindness, especially towards the poor and the needy. His legacy continues to inspire Muslims to strive for peace, justice, and unity.

The Prophet (ﷺ) was looking once at the people and once at Al-Hasan bin `Ali saying, 'This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him." <br /><br />
