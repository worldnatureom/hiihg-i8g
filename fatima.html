			<div class= 'content'>Fatima bint Rasoolallahﷺ was the daughter of the Prophetﷺ through his wife Khadija. Syeda's husband was Imam Ali, the fourth of the Rashidun Caliphs. Syeda's sons were Imamain Hasan and Husayn, She is viewed as an ultimate archetype for Muslim women and an example of compassion, generosity, and enduring suffering. It is through Syeda Fatima that Rasoolallah's family line has survived to this date.

			<p class="desc">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama:
			Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Fatima is a part of me, and he who makes her angry, makes me angry."
			<br><br> Sahih Al Bukharee 3714
			<br /><br /> Syeda Fatima Az Zahra was one of the four daughters of Rasoolallahﷺ, Whatever she hated, was hated by Rasoolallahﷺ. Whatever she loved, was loved by Rasoolallahﷺ and whatever offended her, offended Rasoolallahﷺ</p>
			
			<img src="syeda2.jpg" alt="fadail" width="960px" height="560px" />
			<p class="desc">Rasoolallahﷺ said: "Fatima is a part of my body, and I hate what she hates to see, and what hurts her, hurts me."
			<br><br> Sahih Al Bukharee 5230 <br /><br />With both this hadith and the previous one, we get to know that the most precious thing to Rasoolallahﷺ was his daughter. This also makes it evident that whoever holds hatred for her, have no respect for Rasoolallahﷺ </p>

			<p class="desc">Narrated by Ummul Mu'mineen, the mother of the believers, A'isha (May Allah be pleased with her) that Syeda Fatima had told her that Rasoolallahﷺ said: "'O Fatima! Will you not be pleased that you will be chief of all the believing women?"
			<br><br> Sahih Al Bukharee 6286 <br><br>
			This Hadith explains the most praiseworthy virtue of Syeda Az Zahra, which implies that she would be the queen of the women in paradise.</p>
